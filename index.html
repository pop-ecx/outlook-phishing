  <h2 id="quick-look-at-a-more-believable-phishing-attempt">Would you fall for this?</h2>
  <p>Welcome back. If you are new and have somehow stumbled here, greetings. In this write-up I'm going to show a more believable attempt
  at phishing. So I encounter this types of attacks day-to-day. This particular one, made me chuckle a bit
  and shows some kind of dedication from the threat actor (either that or they were lucky). First things first, it was super targeted.
  It was directed to an actual existing email. There were also other PII associated with the email that shows this was a spear phishing attempt.</p>
  <p>As usual I was more interested in the attachment and quickly obtained it. It was a html document and I was immediately on it doing 
  'analysis'. The structure was nothing new. It was javascript with two variables, one variable being the victim's address and another some weird strings. 
  The rest was just base64 encoding of base64 encoded data.

  <p>Of course decoding it is no big issue really. It reveals some more javascript which is kind of 'obfuscated'. The code seems to do a few things: It declares
  some variables including document.write. It then creates a string by concatenating an empty string with the weird characters between the <strong>&quot;&quot;</strong>. It then calls
  decodeuri() with the created string as its argument. The resulting decoded string is split at each character resulting in a massive array of single characters.
  The characters are then indexed out, building the source code of the page.

  <p>Untangling this mess of a code reveals more html code with some javascript and AJAX calls that does some interesting things.
  <div style="text-align: left;"><img src="/4.png"></div></p>
  <p>After creating a somehow convincing outlook login page with the various animations used during the process, the earlier variable with some 
  weird strings is split at <strong>:</strong>. It then indexes the second part of the string, which looks like base64 encoded URL. This URL turns out to be 
  <strong>http://micro[.]kamikzyias[.]uk/app/MM2[.]php</strong>. This phishing attempt is practically no different from a lot of the others I've seen, only it's a bit more realistic
  and convincing. Also, the subdomain micro.kamikzyias.uk seems to be super involved in these types of attacks. Anyway, as soon as the victim enters
  the credentials needed, the credentials are harvested while redirecting them to legitimate outlook. 
  <div style="text-align: left;"><img src="/5.png" alt="code for POSTing credentials"></div>
  Here's how the page looks like:
  <div style="text-align: left;"><video width="1080" height="740" controls>
    <source src="vid1.mp4" type="video/mp4">
  </video>
  </p></div>
  <p>This looks and feels like legitimate outlook but in real sense it is a credential harvester.
